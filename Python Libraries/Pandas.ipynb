    "# Pandas-DataFrame And Series\n",
    "Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library in Python, widely used for data analysis and data cleaning. It provides two primary data structures: Series and DataFrame. A Series is a one-dimensional array-like object, while a DataFrame is a two-dimensional, size-mutable, and potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns)."
