# This needs to be first file in our package folder
'''__init__.py is a special file used in Python to define packages and initialize their namespaces
__init__.py is a special file that tells Python “this directory should be treated as a package”.
Without it (before Python 3.3), Python wouldn’t recognize the folder as a package you could import.
Any code inside __init__.py runs automatically when the package is imported.'''
